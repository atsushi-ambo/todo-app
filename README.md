# To-Do App

A modern kanban-style task management application developed through collaboration between **human developers** and **generative AI**.

## About This Project

This To-Do App is the result of a unique collaboration between human developers and generative AI (GitHub Copilot). By combining human creativity and problem-solving with AI assistance for code generation, debugging, and feature implementation, we've created an application that demonstrates the potential of human-AI collaboration in software development.

## What's New

- Enhanced smooth transitions and responsive UI for a seamless experience.
- Improved performance with optimized backend processes.
- Updated collaboration flow integrating continuous human-AI improvements.

## Features

- Interactive drag-and-drop interface with smooth animations
- Create, edit, and delete task cards in real-time
- Organize tasks across columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Visual priority indicators and customizable labels
- Editable board title with instant updates
- Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, react-beautiful-dnd
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Development Tools**: GitHub Copilot

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (for local development)

### Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Local Development

1. Start the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend (in a new terminal):
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## How Human-AI Collaboration Works

- **Human Developer**: Led project vision, design improvements and complex problem solving.
- **Generative AI**: Continues to assist with code generation, rapid prototyping, and UI enhancements.

This collaboration showcases how AI can enhance developer productivity while allowing humans to focus on higher-level aspects of software creation.
